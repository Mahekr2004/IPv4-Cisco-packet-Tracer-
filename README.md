IPv4 is the fourth version of the Internet Protocol, using a 32-bit address to route data packets across networks. Its routing is managed by routers that use a routing table to determine the best path for data to reach its destination network. Routing can be configured statically by manually defining routes or dynamically using routing protocols like RIP (Routing Information Protocol) or OSPF to automatically exchange routing information.
